abstract = {Silent packet drops are common in data center networks, and are a major cause of network performance anomalies (NPAs) that have significant impacts on application performance and network management. However, existing solutions using coarse-grained statistics and flow-level telemetry either fail to provide precise location of packet drops or incur large overhead. This paper presents dDrops, a packet-level telemetry based on programmable data plane to detect and retrieve details of silent packet drops immediately when they happen. dDrops can dynamically adapt to varying ratios of silent packet drops for different ports on a switch to improve performance of silent packet drops detection. Moreover, a dynamic memory management scheme is also designed to efficiently use the limited memory on the data plane of switch. dDrops has been implemented on both P4 hardware programmable switches (based on Intel Tofino ASIC) and BMv2. Extensive experiment results show that dDrops is able to detect and locate the silent packet drops within 5 ms (including detailed information of dropped packets), and reduce the memory consumption by up to 50\%.},

abstract = {Future networks are expected to support cross-domain, cost-aware and fine-grained services in an efficient and flexible manner. Service Function Chaining (SFC) has been introduced as a promising approach to deliver these services. In the literature, centralized resource orchestration is usually employed to process SFC requests and manage computing and network resources. However, centralized approaches inhibit the scalability and domain autonomy in multi-domain networks. They also neglect location and hardware dependencies of service chains.
In this paper, we propose Distributed Federated Service Chaining (DFSC), a framework for orchestrating and maintaining SFC placement in a distributed fashion while sharing only a minimal amount of domain information and control. First, a deployment cost minimization problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem with fine-grained constraints for location and hardware dependencies. We show that this problem is NP-hard. Then, a placement algorithm is devised to use information only on inter-domain paths and border nodes. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that DFSC efficiently optimizes the deployment cost, supports domain autonomy and enables faster decision-making. The results also show that DFSC finds solutions within a factor 1.15 of the optimal solution on average. Compared to a centralized approach in the literature, DFSC reduces the deployment cost by up to 20\% and uses 70\% less decision-making time.},

year = {},
abstract = {With the ever-growing demand for low-latency network applications, edge computing emerges as a new paradigm that provides computation and storage resources in close proximity to end-users. Many research efforts have resorted to network function virtualization, wherein network applications are provisioned as service function chains at edge clouds. However, due to the traffic dynamics and limited resource capacity at the network edge, how to efficiently embed service chains with latency optimization and resource efficiency remains as a challenging problem. As most existing research efforts largely overlook the bottlenecked resources of VNFs in the VNF scaling, we seek a more realistic approach to provisioning VNF instances across multiple edge clouds. Also, given the limited resources at the edge, it is of significant importance to improve the VNF utilization rate. Specifically, we formulate the VNF scaling problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, aiming to minimize the endto-end latency for service function chains. To solve this problem, we devise a novel bottleneck-aware algorithm that manages the number and deployment of newly created instances. After that, we propose an online algorithm for traffic steering to improve the utilization rates of VNF instances and avoid congestion on hotspot links. The proposed algorithm is shown to provide good performance by trace-driven simulation in real-world topologies.},

year = {2022},
abstract = {Dynamic service function chains (SFC) are enabled by network function virtualization on general purpose servers. The emergence of programmable data planes (PDP) has offered a new way for the deployment of SFC. However, the implementation of network functions is constrained by resource limitations in PDPs (e.g., compute and memory resource). Moreover, most of existing works do not consider the optimization of state information (e.g., registers), which is essential for stateful network functions. In this paper, we propose pSFC which provides a fine-grained SFC deployment scheme in the PDP to tackle the problem. We first model network functions as control flow graphs (CFG) and the process of deployment as a one big switch (OBS) problem, and then propose an ILP (Integer Linear Programming) model for resource optimization for the OBS problem, which is NP-hard. To solve this problem efficiently, pSFC first composes multiple SFCs for eliminating redundant resources, decomposes the compound CFG based on the resource limitation per stage, and finally maps OBS into the substrate network. We have implemented pSFC in both bmv2 software switch and P4 hardware switch (i.e., Intel Tofino). Evaluation shows that pSFC reduces switch costs 45.7\% and average latency 15\% while providing the correctness of the process of SFC.},

abstract = {Nowadays, Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices generate data at high speed and large volume. Often the data require real-time processing to support high system responsiveness which can be supported by localised Cloud and/or Fog computing paradigms. However, there are considerably large deployments of IoT such as sensor networks in remote areas where Internet connectivity is sparse, challenging the localised Cloud and/or Fog computing paradigms. With the advent of the Raspberry Pi, a credit card-sized single board computer, there is a great opportunity to construct low-cost, low-power portable cloud to support real-time data processing next to IoT deployments. In this paper, we extend our previous work on constructing Raspberry Pi Cloud to study its feasibility for real-time big data analytics under realistic application-level workload in both native and virtualised environments. We have extensively tested the performance of a single node Raspberry Pi 2 Model B with httperf and a cluster of 12 nodes with Apache Spark and HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). Our results have demonstrated that our portable cloud is useful for supporting real-time big data analytics. On the other hand, our results have also unveiled that overhead for CPU-bound workload in virtualised environment is surprisingly high, at 67.2%. We have found that, for big data applications, the virtualisation overhead is fractional for small jobs but becomes more significant for large jobs, up to 28.6%.},
